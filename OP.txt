This is a server-only mod used for automatic shutting down after specified time with no players online. From version 0.5.0 it is also capable of shutting down server at specified times (uses quite powerful cron-like syntax for definition of time).

[size=6]Installation[/size]
0) if you don't have forge, get it [url="http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Universal"]here[/url]
1) downloaded zip/jar file into your "minecraft/mods" directory (if the name of downloaded file contains "packed" text then unpack it first)
2) run server, shutdown server, modify config to your liking

[size=6]Configuration file[/size]
Sample config file:
[code]general {
    B:enabled=true
    B:"force save"=true
    I:minutes=10
    B:idleShutdown=false
    I:minutes=10
    B:timeShutdown=true
    S:timeShutdownPattern=*/1 * * * *
}[/code][list]
[*]enabled - should the mod be working?
[*]force save - should the mod be doing "save-all" one minute before expected shutdown?
[*]minutes - number of player-free minutes after the server will be turned off
[*]idleShutdown - shutdown after exact time with no players online
[*]timeShutdown - shutdown at exact times
[*]timeShutdownPattern - cron-like time pattern - for more info use google or http://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/cron4j/manual.php#p02 . Tip: You can input multiple cont-like patterns separated by "|".
[/list]
[size=6]Commands[/size]
[code]/asd = /autoshutdown
usage: /asd [postpone=pp|on|off|status=s|about]
postpone|pp - set player-free minutes counter to 0
off - turn mod off
on - turn mod on
status|s - print status information
about - print about text
[/code]
All settings done through command(s) are NOT saved to the config!

[size=6]Example of Server Setup[/size]
I wrote a short article describing how to use this mod with other commands/tools (under Linux). It can be found [url="http://366.hopto.org/blog/english/minecraft-server-with-forge-on-demand/"]here[/url].

[size=6]Known Bugs[/size]
I'm not sure if I ever correct these little bugs, they really don't affect much the functionality.

- It uses sampling approach, so the accuracy is 1m.
- Scheduled shutdown is commited in +1m after scheduled time (actually it's only marked to shudown, so it can even happen in +2m).
